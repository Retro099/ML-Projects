## Overview
Predicts which customers are likely to churn so teams can act before they leave.

## Dataset
- Source: [ADD LINK/NAME]
- Target: churn (0/1)
- Notes: encoding categoricals, missing values handled, train/val split.

## Models & Metrics
- Tried: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, (optional) XGBoost/NN
- Final: [FILL]
- Metrics: Accuracy [FILL], F1 [FILL], ROC-AUC [FILL]

## Tech
Python • pandas • scikit-learn • (TensorFlow if used) • Colab ↔ GitHub

## Run
**Colab:** use the badge above.
**Local:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Retro099/ML-Projects.git
cd ML-Projects/Customer_Churn_Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
# open notebooks/Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb
```
